which ontains verifications against CERES and CALIPSO and updated CAMS and GPCP datasets


-------------------------------------------------------------
*  modified ss2gg, save disk space by 50% and CPU 30~50%
  new ss2ggx contains Ps, T, U,V, Q, RH, O3 and CLW

*  converting one T1534 sig file to 768x384 grid takes about 1 minutes,  each file is 500MB
*  converting one T1534 sig file to 1152x576 grid takes about 2 minutes,  each file is 1.2GB
*  converting one T1534 sig file to 1760x880 grid takes about 4 minutes,  each file is 2.7GB
*  converting one TL574 sig file to 1152x576 grid takes about 0.5 minutes
* 
*  split the conversion to many small batch jobs and wait for all conversion jobs to finish before making maps.
   each job converts  3 days of siganl and sigges for all four ccycles, in toatl 24 files
   T1534 ->1152x576   needs 48 minutes in total
   TL574 ->1152x576   needs 12 minutes in total
